This is where we can put some possible feature ideas for the project.

- Icons for items
- Duration events as background (so like a time period where something happened, like the church timeline)
- descriptions for events (mouse  over to display)
- manual length adjustment 
- label for axis
- "EditCategory" window with color
- ImageIcons for events - uploadable (KAYLEY)
- Zoom in/out
- Descriptions for events that show hovered over the label on mouse over (CSS?)
- Labels show at different heights/do not overlap
- Font choice!
