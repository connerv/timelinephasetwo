This is where we can put some possible feature ideas for the project.

- Icons for items
- Duration events as background (so like a time period where something happened, like the church timeline)
- descriptions for events, maybe mouse  over to display (JOSH: database and model, GUI will have to wait)
- manual length adjustment / zoomin/zoomout
- label for axis (We already have this?)
- "EditCategory" window with color (ANDREW)
- ImageIcons for events - uploadable (KAYLEY)
- Labels show at different heights/do not overlap
- Font choice!
